function [y] = sortDiff(y,x,tol)
% y must be a struct with:
%
% PhiQp PhiQn PhiFp PhiFn PsiQp PsiFp PsiQn PsiFn lp ln s kp kn
%
% Sort the matrix k by calculating the angle as function of f. If there is
% an angle where a(n)-a(n-1) > tol, the rows of the matrices are swapped by the
% row with the closest angle to the angle a(n)
% The number of rows in y must be the same number of elements in x.

% This is a fine tuned code, so it works in a very specific and restricted
% condition. Of course it can be fine tunned for each case. I tried to
% stablish a value for "tol" and "tol2" in which the code could work in
% any situation, but it was not tested. The tol is the most important
% condition. It looks at the diff matrix and checks which rows (or
% wavemodes) presents a discontinuity which basically means a bad sorting
% of the k (wavenumbers or eigenvalues) array. The if statement detects a
% discontinuity by comparing one value with its next value in the freq
% dimension of the matrix. If the difference is bigger than tol, it is
% considered a dicontinuity. This difference is in general (when there is
% no discontinuity) defined by the size of the x array in "radSlope". The
% smaller the deltax, the bigger are the differences bewteen one freq and
% the next. By tweeking this x array, I tried to make it so that the
% differences are comparativelly bigger when there is a discontinuity, than
% when there is simply a smooth increase of the slope value (which is
% normal and expercted).
